I will upload the code and preprocessed data for our participation in DrugProt challenge.

Despite the class imbalances in the BioCreative VII DrugProt test corpus, our model achieves a good performance compared to the average of other submissions in the challenge, with the micro F1 score of 55.67% (and 63% on BioCreative VI ChemProt test corpus).
